# Height vs menstrual cycle

Measuring height changes

Create two reference lines in very fine tip marker, some distance apart (maybe 2 cm).

Every day, measure height using a pencil mark.

Take photo.

Annotate the three lines in each photo.

One photo should have just the reference lines.

When annotating photos, present them in random order.

Does this work any faster now that I deleted a bunch of content??

# Height vs menstrual cycle

Measuring height changes

Create two reference lines in very fine tip marker, some distance apart (maybe 2 cm).

Every day, measure height using a pencil mark.

Take photo.

Annotate the three lines in each photo.

One photo should have just the reference lines.

When annotating photos, present them in random order.

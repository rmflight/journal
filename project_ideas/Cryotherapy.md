# Cryotherapy

The progression is:
- short period of cold in shower
- full cold shower
- ice baths around 55
- work down to 32

The key is that you should never shivver or gasp, if you do go back a step.

Other things:
- don't drive right after swimming
- pay attention to afterdrop (hypothermia after exiting water usually when it's windy)
- it's not something you should push

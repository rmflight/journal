Aluminum pipe with aluminum tubes, airflow out.

They are inside a large PVC pipe, with holes near end drawing air in. Air in PVC is exchanging heat with air going out aluminum pipe.

Aluminum pipes are angled down to allow condensation to run out. Also, all air holes back in are on bottom.

Embedded in block of foam for insulation in house.

Small bore aluminum pipe with bent aluminum rods on outside??


Option 2

Blocks of styrofoam for passageway.

Heat exchange via a baffle of aluminum sheeting, bent to create many folds over distance, but still slow air to move.

Cut into foam, and then seal aluminum into the cuts to provide air tight seal.

Foam ks naturally insulating. Angle to provide drainage of any condensation again.

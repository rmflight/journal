Aluminum pipe with aluminum tubes, airflow out.

They are inside a large PVC pipe, with holes near end drawing air in. Air in PVC is exchanging heat with air going out aluminum pipe.

Aluminum pipes are angled down to allow condensation to run out. Also, all air holes back in are on bottom.

Embedded in block of foam for insulation in house.

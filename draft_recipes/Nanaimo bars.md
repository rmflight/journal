# Nanaimo bars

## Crust

½ cup butter, unsalted
▢½ cup cocoa powder
▢1/2 cup sugar
▢1 egg, whisked
▢1 ½ cup graham cracker crumbs
▢¾ cup coconut, shredded, unsweetened
▢¼ cup pecans, finely chopped

Line a square baking dish with parchment paper so that the parchment paper overhangs the edges. Cut two long rectangular pieces of parchment paper and overlap them. The overhang will be used to pull the bars out of the tray for easier slicing. For thicker bars use an 8×8 inch dish, for thinner bars use a 9×9 inch dish.

Prepare the crust. Set up a double boiler on your oven, on medium high heat bring a pot with 2 cups of water to a boil. Carefully place a heat proof metal bowl on top. Add ½ cup of butter to the bowl and allow to melt. Note: be sure that the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. The steam from the boiling water will heat the bowl enough to melt the contents.

When fully melted stir in the cocoa powder and sugar. Whisk until melted.

Quickly pour in the whisked egg and whisk until thickened.

Remove bowl from heat. Fold in the graham cracker crumbs, pecans and coconut until evenly combined.

Pour the crust mixture into the lined baking dish and spread it out evenly. Use a cup to firmly press the crust down. Place in the fridge.

## Filling

½ cup butter, unsalted, room temperature
▢2 cups icing sugar
▢3 tablespoons milk
▢2 tablespoons custard powder, or vanilla pudding mix

Prepare the filling by adding all of the filling ingredients to a medium sized bowl and whisking by hand or with an electric mixer until light and fluffy.

Chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour. The filling must be chilled or it will melt when the chocolate layer is poured on top!

## Topping
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
▢1 cup semi-sweet chocolate, chips, bars or melting wafers
▢1 tablespoon butter, unsalted

Prepare the chocolate topping. Using the double boiler again and a clean metal bowl, add the chocolate and butter. Stir continuously until fully melted.

Remove the baking dish from the fridge and quickly pour the chocolate on top. Use a spatula or spoon to evenly spread the chocolate. You can use the back of a spoon or other utensil to create a design on the chocolate if desired (ex. Swirls).

When ready to slice the bars, use the parchment paper to pull the whole bar out of the baking dish. 

Place a large sharp knife in a tall cup and pour in hot water. Allow to sit for 2-3 minutes to warm up the knife, or run warm water over the knife in a sink for 2-3 minutes.

Carefully slice the bars and clean the knife after each slice so the chocolate does not smudge onto the middle cream layer.

Serve and enjoy!

Store bars in an air tight container in the fridge. If stacking the bars in a container place a piece of parchment paper between the layers so they do not stick

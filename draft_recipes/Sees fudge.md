# Sees fudge

*See’s Fudge*

I know it’s synonymous with airports at this point but when I was a kid See’s Candies was where it was AT. The sheer amount of nostalgia connected to those Candy boxes is overwhelming in the best possible way. I don’t know how my mom got their recipe for fudge because Google wasn’t a thing and the internet didn’t exist. It’s an actual mystery to me but I don’t ask questions I just let myself feel Christmas spirit and the pure joy of stolen fudge. God bless us. Everyone. Especially my sneaky beautiful treat making mother.

1 stick unsalted butter cut into pats
1 12oz bag semi sweet chocolate chips
1 cup granulated sugar
1 cup light brown sugar
6oz can evaporated milk
1/2 tsp salt
40 mini marshmallows 

In a large mixing bowl add butter and chocolate chips. Set aside. In a tallish sauce pan add sugars, marshmallows, evaporated milk, and salt. Heat over medium high heat whisking constantly. Bring to a hard simmer for 6 minutes, making sure the sugars have melted down and it’s not boiling over. Remove from heat and pour over chocolate and butter. Stir with a spatula until everything has melted into each other. I like to whisk for some extra smoothness. Spray a 6 cup container with cooking spray and transfer chocolate mixture. Sprinkle with sea salt and let cool. Once at room temperature cover and chill in the fridge overnight. Apologize to your dentist.
